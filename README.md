### Step 3: Install Adobe Applications

#### 3.1 Configure Creative Cloud to Run as Administrator

   - Default path: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Creative Cloud\ACC`
2. Find the `Creative Cloud.exe` file
3. Right-click → `Properties` → `Compatibility` tab
4. **Check** ✅ "**Run this program as an administrator**"

- **Pinned Taskbar Icons**

#### ❌ Incorrect Way to Launch

**Do not** launch programs using the **"Open"** button in the Creative Cloud window!
